The error message "Failed to get Firebase project staging" usually indicates that the Firebase CLI can't find the project ID named "staging" in your Firebase project list, or your account doesn’t have the necessary permissions.

Here’s how to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

1. Verify Firebase Project ID
Make sure you are using the correct project ID in your .firebaserc file. To check your Firebase project ID:

Go to the Firebase Console (https://console.firebase.google.com/).
Select your project (pka-earthmovers), and note the exact project ID.
In your .firebaserc file, ensure the correct project ID is listed as default, and remove "staging" if it’s not needed.

Example of Updated .firebaserc
json
Copy code
{
  "projects": {
    "default": "pka-earthmovers"
  },
  "targets": {
    "pka-earthmovers": {
      "hosting": {
        "pka-earthmovers-site": ["default"]
      }
    }
  }
}
2. Remove or Update the Staging Project Reference
If you don’t have a "staging" environment, simply remove it from your .firebaserc file. If you need it, make sure it’s configured correctly in Firebase Console:

Either update "staging" to a valid project ID in Firebase, or remove it if not in use.
3. Use firebase use to Set the Correct Project
Run the following command to explicitly set the correct project for your directory:

bash
Copy code
firebase use pka-earthmovers
This will link the current directory to the pka-earthmovers project, ensuring that any firebase deploy commands reference the correct project.

4. Re-authenticate with Firebase CLI (Optional)
If you continue to face issues, try re-authenticating with Firebase CLI:

bash
Copy code
firebase logout
firebase login
5. Deploy
After making these adjustments, try deploying again:

bash
Copy code
firebase deploy
By ensuring the correct project ID is set, this should resolve the "Failed to get Firebase project" error. Let me know if you continue to face issues or if you need further help!
